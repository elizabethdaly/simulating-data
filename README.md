## 1. Introduction <a name="intro"></a>


## 2. Instructions <a name="section2"></a>
- This README describes work done for the Programming for Data Analysis module project, due 13 December 2019. 
- Resources used include Python and associated packages Jupyter, matplotlib, and NumPy. These come as part of the Anaconda distribution of Python.
- The analysis takes the form of a single Jupyter notebook of filename given above. To view this file, download it from this repository and start Jupyter notebook from the folder containing the file: type **Jupyter notebook** on the command line.
- Alternatively, view a static version of the notebook (by providing its GitHub url) using Jupyter Nbviewer.
- All images intended for inclusion in this README are located in the **images** subdirectory of this repository.
- I would like for this README to complement the analyses performed in the notebook rather than just repeat what's done there.
