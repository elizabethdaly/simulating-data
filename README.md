## 1. Information <a name="information"></a>
- This README describes work done for the Programming for Data Analysis module project, due 13 December 2019. 
- Resources used include Python and associated packages Jupyter, matplotlib, and NumPy. 
- The analysis takes the form of a single Jupyter notebook of filename given above. To view this file, download it from this repository and start Jupyter notebook from the folder containing the file. Jupyter notebook comes as part of the Anaconda distribution of Python (as do the other packages listed above). 
- Alternatively, view a static version of the notebook (by providing its GitHub url) using Jupyter Nbviewer.
- All images intended for inclusion in this README are located in the **images** subdirectory of this repository.
- I have tried to structure the Jupyter notebook and this README so that they have corresponding sections. I will endeavour to have this README complement the analyses performed in the notebook.

## 2. Introduction <a name="section2"></a>

The question I want to address with this project is: What is the distribution of short-sightedness (myopia) in a random sample of the population?
What is myopia? A pic.
How is it quantified? Diopters
Why this question? Personal (daughter) and professional (past work). Give bit more detail.
Aim: to produce an image like: find histogram of frequency vs refractive error.
Risk factors for myopia. Possible variables.
