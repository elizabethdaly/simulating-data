## 1. Information <a name="information"></a>
- This README describes work done for the Programming for Data Analysis module project, due 13 December 2019. 
- Resources used include Python and associated packages Jupyter, matplotlib, and NumPy. 
- The analysis takes the form of a single Jupyter notebook of filename given above. To view this file, download it from this repository and start Jupyter notebook from the folder containing the file. Jupyter notebook comes as part of the Anaconda distribution of Python (as do the other packages listed above). 
- Alternatively, view a static version of the notebook (by providing its GitHub url) using Jupyter Nbviewer.
- All images intended for inclusion in this README are located in the **images** subdirectory of this repository.
- I have tried to structure the Jupyter notebook and this README so that they have corresponding sections. I will endeavour to have this README complement the analyses performed in the notebook.

## 2. Introduction <a name="section2"></a>

The question I want to address with this project is: What is the distribution of short-sightedness (myopia) in a random sample of the population? 

### What is myopia?
Myopia is also referred to as short-sightedness or near-sightedness. I will stick to using the term myopia as it saves a bit of typing. It is an eye condition which causes distant objects to appear blurry while only very close objects appear clearly. It happens because light entering the eye comes to a focus in front of (rather than on) the back of the eye - the retina. This means that the clearest image of the object is formed in front of the retina rather than on it, where our brain records images. It is a refractive error of the eye: as light travels through the eye it is bent (refracted) and absorbed by the different structures it passes through, primarily the cornea and the lens. The cornea is the front surface of the eye and the lens is a transparent element behind the iris that helps to bring light to a focus. If the end result is that the light from an object comes to a focus away from the retina, then that person has a refractive error. In myopia light from distant objects comes to a focus in front of the retina.

There are other common refractive errors apart from myopia. These include hyperopia (light comes to a focus behind the retina) and astigmatism (light along the horizontal and vertical axes comes to a focus at different points). A person with normal vision is emmetropic or, an emmetrope. These different situations are illustrated below.

### How is it quantified/corrected?
Diopters

### Why this question?
Personal (daughter) and professional (past work). Give bit more detail.

### Aim: 
to produce an image like: find histogram of frequency vs refractive error.
Risk factors for myopia. Possible variables.
