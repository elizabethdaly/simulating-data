# Simulation of a dataset relating to eyesight
# 52465 Programming for Data Analysis

## Project description

This README describes work done for the Programming for Data Analysis module project, due 16 December 2019.

We have been asked to simulate a real-world phenomenon of our own choosing. Our task is to model and synthesize data relating to this phenomenon using Python, in particular the numpy.random package. The end product of this project should be a synthesized data set. I will examine the phenomenon of eyesight, specifically short-sightedness (also referred to as myopia). I wish to create a data set of variables associated with myopia. I would like to simulate the distribution of short-sightedness (myopia) in a random sample of the population. I would also like to explore the relationships, if any, between factors which seem to contribute to myopia.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- [Anaconda distribution of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
- [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/)
- [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
- [matplotlib: Python plotting library](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

### Installing
Download and install the Anaconda distribution of Python from the link above. The other packages (Jupyter notebook, Pandas, matplotlib, NumPy, and SciPy) come as part of that distribution.

### Project repository
This project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) at 
https://github.com/elizabethdaly/simulating-data.git

The analysis takes the form of a single Jupyter notebook of filename **eyesight.ipynb**

### Instructions for cloning the repository


### Static version of the notebook
Alternatively, one can view a static version of the notebook using [Jupyter Nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Enter the GitHub url to view the file.
